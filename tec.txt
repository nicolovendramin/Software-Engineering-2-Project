  \section{Introduction}
  \subsection{Description of the given Problem} \paragraph{} We will project and implement the PowerEnJoy system for the car-sharing service
  of electric cars. The service will be based on a mobile application interacting with an online server
  that can be accessed by anyone in possess of an iOS or Android smartphone.
  \paragraph{}The system allows the user to login or, in case he/she is a new user, to register providing credentials and payment information. After logging in the application for the user will be possible to navigate a map in order to locate
  the available cars within a certain distance from him/her or from a specified address. The system gives the user the possibility to 
  book the car that he/she wants to use. After the booking is completed the user must reach the vehicle within one hour, otherwise the 
  booking expires, the car is tagged again as available and the user is charged with a fee. When a booking is active the system 
  provides the user with the possibility to
  ask the system to unlock the car in order to start the rent. During the rent the user is informed of the real-time cost of the rent
  through a screen placed in the car; moreover, as soon as the car is parked in one of the predefined safe areas, the system calculates
  the final charge for the user applying some discounts in case of certain positive behaviours being detected. When the rent is over 
  and
  the user has left the car the system locks it again and adds it to the available cars.
  \subsubsection{Target User} \paragraph{}The only actor that is going to interact with the system is the final customer of the rental service, above 
  called: the user. The systems allows only registered users to access the rental service, and offers to the new users nothing but the 
  possibility to register.
  \subsection{Existing system} \paragraph{} The mobile application which composes the new system interacts with a previously designed 
  system which has been developed in order to administrate the vehicles that are used for the rental service. This existing system 
  periodically 
  retrieves data from the cars and populates a database in which for every car is stored the information about power, position and 
  everything else that can be useful for the service. In addition it offers to the employees of the company the possibility to 
  manage the available vehicles manually, for example removing them by the system if a problem is detected, and some features for 
  automatic problem handling such as removing a car with unsufficient power and signaling it to an operator that can move the car and
  plug it in in one of the service areas.
  \paragraph{}In order to offer the service to the final customer no legacy system is present so that the new product can be
  designed without constraints imposed by previous implementations.
  \subsection{Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations}
  \subsubsection{Definitions}
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{User:} User is used to indicate the generic person that access the application.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Client:} This term is used to identify each user registered in the application, that has been correctly 
    identified by the system through the log in procedure. In order to register to the service the client need to
    provide the following information:
    \begin{enumerate}[-]
      \item Name
      \item Surname
      \item Birthday
      \item Driving License Number
      \item Driving License Expiration Date
      \item e-Mail (unique)
      \item Password for the service
      \item Credit/Debit Card Number
      \item Credit/Debit Card Security Code
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Car:} It is a vehicle that can be used for the rental service offered by the application. Every car is
    equipped with GPS, Power level sensor, pressure sensors, plug-detection sensor (distinguish whether the car is plugged or not)
    ,a timer that monitors the duration of each rent and a small monitor.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Ride:} It is the unit of use of the rental service. The period between the ingition of the car and the end of the 
    rent. The client is charged proportionally to the duration of the ride.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Reservation:} It is the booking of one of the available cars so that other people cannot use it. A reservation
    lasts for a period of maximum one hour after which it expires. In order to open a vehicle the client must reserve it before.
    It is identified by the expiration time, the user id and the car identifier.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Notification:} It is a pop up message that is displayed on the client's smartphone. Notifications are used 
    by the application to comunicate important messages.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{System:} It is the new system, composed by a mobile application for devices running either iOS or Android. The 
    new System access the data contained in the database of the old system.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Legacy:} It is the existing system used to manage the vehicles and their state. The Legacy system is not going
    to be replaced by the new System. The two system are going to interact in order to offer to the final customer access to the service.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Safe Area:} It is one of the zones of the city in which is possible to leave the car at the end of the rent.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Re-charge Site:} It is a Safe Area in which there is the possibility to plug the car to refill the battery.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Billing Service:} It is the service that is used from the application to charge the user with the amount needed 
    to pay the ride.

  \subsection{Identifying Stakeholders} The main stakeholder of the system is the company commissioning its realization. 
  Other stakeholders 
  are the city (both governance and population) in which the system has to be used,
  the other companies offering similar services and also the public transportations providers. Ecologists organizations can also be
  considered as stakeholders since this new service is going to provide a "green" alternative for moving in the city.
  \subsection{Reference Documents} This document has been written following the IEEE standard number 830-1998 "Recommmended Practice
  fir Siftware Requirements Secifications".
  \subsection{Overview} \paragraph{} The rest of this document contains an overall description of the software product
(section 2), the specific requirements for the system (section 3) and the appendix
(section 4). The appendix contains all UML diagrams useful to describe the
functionalities of the software, some scenarios and the Alloy modeling.
  \section{Overall Description}
  \subsection{Domain Properties and Assumptions}
  In this section we analyize all the properties of the application domain of the system in order to describe the environment in which it 
  operates. 
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\bullet$] All the GPS (both on the user phones and on the cars) always give the right postion.
    \item[$\bullet$] All the power level and pressure sensors mounted on the cars are giving the correct data.
    \item[$\bullet$] The previous system which manages the cars is already populated and working.
    \item[$\bullet$] The credentials provided by the user are unique (e-mail as id).
    \item[$\bullet$] If a car is marked as available, it is present on the map and it is actually available for the rent.
    \item[$\bullet$] All the cars present on the system are working properly.
    \item[$\bullet$] A car present on the system can be only in one of the following states: available, booked or in rent.
    \item[$\bullet$] The client is billed for the use of the service using an external service.
    \item[$\bullet$] Any information about the vehicles is gathered by the new System via direct access to the database of the existing system.
    \item[$\bullet$] The other system works correctly without problems.
    \item[$\bullet$] In case of any extraordinary event handling (car accidents, system not working) the operators that works 
    for the existing service will manually intervene and manage the problem.
    \item[$\bullet$] Any time a car is left unplugged with very low power level, it is not retagged as available until the 
    power level reaches again a minimum level.
    \item[$\bullet$] We assume that is possible to check the corrispondence between Name+Surname+Birthday and Driving License Number+Expiration Date
    using an external institutional service.
    \item[$\bullet$] We assume that when a car is unlocked, the one who access it and uses it is always the owner
    of the reservation. For this reason no further cross-check is needed.
    \item[$\bullet$] We assume that is possible to identify without ambiguity the cars using their plate.
    \item[$\bullet$] The billing service never fails or if it does it handles internally any problem.
    \item[$\bullet$] The operators of the existing service periodically checks the cars in order to ensure that their status is
    \item[$\bullet$] We assume that the database with the data related to the cars is associated a middleware that is able to notify
    the system when the status of a variable changes (e.g.: engine ignition sends a control message to the existing system which 
    changes the corresponding variable in the database. The change is advertised by the middleware to the other system)
    \item[$\bullet$] Between the moment in which the map with available cars is updated the most recent time and the moment in which 
    the user performs the booking no one of the available cars has changed its status.
  \end{description}
  \subsection{Goals} \paragraph{} Here is the list of goals, intended as the actions that the system allow the user to do:
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G0]} Allows everyone to register on the system
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G1]} Allows the client to login
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G2]} Allows the client to check the cars available within a certain distance from a specified position
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G3]} Allows the client to check the cars available within a certain distance from their position
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G4]} Allows the client to book a vehicle for a rent
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G5]} Allows the client to open the booked vehicle if the booking has not expired yet and he is close to it
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G6]} Allows the client to update his/her credentials or payment details
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G7]} Conclude the rent and be notified when the rent is over and the payment is successfully completed
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G8]} Allows the client to inspect the power level of a selected car before booking it
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G9]} Allows the client to identify the localization of the safe areas where the vehicle can be left
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G10]} Allows the client to cancel an existing booking up to the expiration time.
  \end{description}
  \subsection{Actors Identifying}
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{User:} Everyone willing to use the application that has not been registered yet. They can’t access 
    the application functionality but the registration form.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Client:} Every registered user willing to use the application. They can access the complete functionality of the application.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Online Application Server:} This is the main brain of the application system which executes the queries of the users and clients through the Mobile Application,
    taking also into account the situation in the other actors such as Billing system and Existing System.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Mobile Application:} This is the interface from where the users can query query demands 
    and visualise the answers by the Online Application Server.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Billing Service:} Provides APIs to charge the user with the cost of the ride.	
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Existing Service:}  It is the previous system which handles the majority of situations that our application takes for granted.
  \end{description}
  \subsection{Constraints} 
  \subsubsection{Regulatory Policies}
  \paragraph{} The system requires the user smartphone location, who must agree to provide 
  it together with its e-mail, phone and personal data in order to allow a positive application performance. The form will also explain 
  its privacy law and will make users check the option 
  “I’ve read and I agree to service terms and conditions” before proceeding to users registration.
  \subsubsection{Hardware Limitations}
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\bullet$] Mobile Application:
    \begin{enumerate}[-]
      \item Smartphone.
      \item 3G Connection.
      \item GPS enabled.
      \item 30 Mb of free space in the users device.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[$\bullet$] Online Application Service:
    \begin{enumerate}[-]
      \item Apache Server with permissions to access the existing system’s database.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{description}
  \subsubsection{Parallel Operations} The application server must support parallel operations from different 
  users or clients.
  \subsection{Interfaces to other applications} \paragraph{} The mobile application will interact with the web server,
  querying demands and retrieving the results computed by this one.
  The application server will interact with the existent system to handle general errors and to retrieves or update the data about
  the cars used for the service.
  The application server will interact with the billing system to handle all the tasks related to payments and billing.
  \section{Requirements}
  \subsection{External Interface Requirements}
  \subsubsection{User Interfaces} \paragraph{} The service is accessed by the user through a mobile application with a simple
  and immediate user interface. The user interface must be easy to understand for the user and must provide access to each 
  functionality with at most 3 taps. Example for the style of the user interface are represented by the following figures: Figure 1, Figure 2 
  and Figure 3.

  \begin{figure}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{map.jpg}
    \caption{Mock-up of the desirede interface: map}
  \end{figure}
  \subsubsection{Software Interfaces} \paragraph{} The service must communicate with the software interfaces of both the legacy
  system for the management of the cars and the billing service which provides support for all the payment and billing operations. 
  In addition the server module must be integrated with a DBMS in order to access the data stored in the data base of the existing 
  service.
  \subsubsection{Communication Interface} \paragraph{} The client module and the server module communicate using the internet and the 
  standard TCP/IP protocol.

  \section{Scenarios and UML Models}
  \subsection{Scenarios}
  \subsubsection{Scenario 1}
  \paragraph{} Joan went out to party with his friends, and he has been so lucky that he managed to
  convince a girl that was worthy to spend the night with
  him. But Joan has no car and he feels ashamed to ask the girl to go to his flat using the metro. So comes to Joan's mind the fact that a 
  couple of month before he had registered himself to PowerEnJoy, he opens the app on his smartphone, he finds a car 800 meters away from
  his position and even if it has just 40\% of the battery he books it. Once he his 2 meters away from the car the app allows him to open it
  and so that the ride can start. In 20 minutes he and his new friend are in his flat drinking a glass 
  of good wine and enjoying the night. 
  The only problem is that, being really excited for the night to come, Joan forgot to plug the car in at the safe area and when he 
  saw the confirmation of the payment he realized that he had been charged for an extra 30\% because of his swallow behaviour.
  \subsubsection{Scenario 2}
  \paragraph{} Sara last night was out with three friends of her, but after drinking a couple of cocktails at the club
  she was convinced by a guy to follow him to his flat and she ended up in his bed. This morning she needed to come back to her house 
  and so she asked to a friend of her if he could come and pick her. But while she was waiting for the reply came to her mind that nice 
  service that her one-night partner and her had used the night before and she decided to register. She opened her smartphone and downloaded
  the application from the app store. As soon as the app was opened she was asked to register and, after 5 minutes needed to fill in the
  subscription form, she was granted complete access to the functionalities of the service. Since her friend still had to reply she
  decided to give a look at the cars close to her position and she booked one. As soon as the booking was completed her friend texted her 
  that he was almost there. For this reason Sara opened the app again and cancelled the booking.
  \subsubsection{Scenario 3}
  \paragraph{} Paolo is coming back from a conference in Geneve, and his train is arriving in 10 minutes at the Central Station. He
  is in a hurry because he has to meet with some people and so he must find an alternative to public transportations to get home. He was 
  registered to several car sharing apps. He opens PowerEnJoy, logs in looks for the cars in the surroundings of the 
  central station and books a car 300m away from the station. As soon as he arrives to the 
  central station, while he was walking outside he sees the bus that he could take to go home arriving at the stop and so, caught by the 
  hurry to go home, he runs and catches the bus. Paolo manages to get home in time and he forgots to delete the reservation on the
  PowerEnJoy application. For that reason 1 hour after performing his booking Paolo receives a notification of the expiration of his 
  booking and of the payment of a 1\textdollar fee.
  \subsubsection{Scenario 4} \paragraph{} Chaval's driving license expired 2 days ago and he went to the office to renew it. He his really 
  concerned about the environment and in particular about the problem of pollution. For this reason he always go to work using his bike
  exception made for those days in which either its heavy raining or it snowing. In those days Chaval uses the cars of the 
  PowerEnJoy service. As soon as he receives his new driving license Chaval opens the app, and updates his credentials. After a quick 
  check of the data he is confirmed of the successfull update of his personal information.
  \subsubsection{Scenario 5} \paragraph{}  Fabrizio is the singer of a band that plays Italian music. They are called the Follonis. 
  Usually Gigi, the only one of the group's members that had a car, goes to the house of each one of the 4 components of
  the group to pick them up to go to the studio where they have their rehearsals. But last wednesday Gigi's car went on fire 
  and now they don't know how to go to the studio. But Fabrizio, which was informed by his friend Sara about the PowerEnjoy 
  application, logs into the app, checks the safe areas and sees that luckily there is a safe area with plugs really close to 
  their rehearsal's venue. So he decides to book the car, he starts the rent, he picks up his friends and, after
  arriving 
  to their final destination, he parks the car and plugs it in. For this reason Fabrizio receives a double discount
  on it's charge: 30\% because he plugged the car in and an additional 10\% because he shared the ride with 3 other
  passengers.

  \subsection{State Chart Models}
  \paragraph{} The following models represent the state chart for the Car and Booking entity. The other entities are not 
  represented with the state chart model because their representation doesn't fit well into a discrete state chart.
  \subsubsection{Car's State Chart}

  \subsection{Class Diagram}
  \paragraph{} In the following page is reported the class diagram of the modellized entities of the world. All the details
  about the methods are omitted to make it easier to be understood. In addition in some cases also some
  details about the attributes of the single class is left out in order to make the representation more direct and easy-to-read.
