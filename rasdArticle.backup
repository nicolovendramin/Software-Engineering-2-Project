  \section{Introduction}
  \subsection{Description of the given Problem} \paragraph{} We will project and implement the PowerEnJoy system for the car-sharing service
  of electric cars. The service will be based on a mobile application interacting with an online server
  that can be accessed by anyone in possess of an iOS or Android smartphone.
  \paragraph{}The system allows the user to log in or, in case he/she is a new user, to register providing credentials and payment information. 
  After logging into the application it is also possible to locate
  the available cars within a certain distance from the user's position or from a specified address. The system also provides the possibility to 
  book one of the shown cars. After the booking is completed the user must reach the vehicle within one hour, otherwise the 
  booking expires, the car is tagged again as available and the user is charged with a fee. When a booking is active the system 
  provides the user with the possibility to
  ask the system to unlock the car in order to start the rent. During the rent the client is informed of the real-time cost of the rent
  through a screen placed in the car; moreover, as soon as the car is parked in one of the predefined safe areas, the system calculates
  the final charge for the user applying some discounts in case of certain positive behaviours being detected. When the rent is over 
  and
  the user has left the car the system locks it again and adds it to the available cars.
  \subsubsection{Target User} \paragraph{}The only actor that is going to interact with the system is the final customer of the rental service, above 
  called: the user. The systems allows only registered users to access the rental service, and offers to the new users nothing but the 
  possibility to register.
  \subsection{Existing system} \paragraph{} The mobile application which composes the new system interacts with a previously designed 
  system which has been developed in order to administrate the vehicles that are used for the rental service. This existing system 
  periodically 
  retrieves data from the cars and populates a database in which for every car is stored the information about power, position and 
  everything else that can be useful for the service. In addition it offers to the employees of the company the possibility to 
  manage the available vehicles manually, for example removing them by the system if a problem is detected, and some features for 
  automatic problem handling such as removing a car with unsufficient power and signaling it to an operator that can move the car and
  plug it in in one of the service areas.
  
  \subsection{Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations}
  \subsubsection{Definitions}
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{User:} It is used to indicate the generic person that access the application.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Client:} This term is used to identify each user registered in the application, that has been correctly 
    identified by the system through the log in procedure. In order to register to the service the client need to
    provide the following information:
    \begin{enumerate}[-]
      \item Name
      \item Surname
      \item Birthday
      \item Driving License Number
      \item Driving License Expiration Date
      \item e-Mail (unique)
      \item Password for the service
      \item Credit/Debit Card Number
      \item Credit/Debit Card Security Code
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Car:} It is a vehicle that can be used for the rental service offered by the application. Every car is
    equipped with GPS, Power level sensor, pressure sensors, plug-detection sensor (distinguish whether the car is plugged or not)
    ,a timer that monitors the duration of each rent and a small monitor.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Ride:} It is the unit of use of the rental service. The period between the ingition of the car and the end of the 
    rent. The client is charged proportionally to the duration of the ride.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Reservation:} It is the booking of one of the available cars so that other people cannot use it. A reservation
    lasts for a period of maximum one hour after which it expires. In order to open a vehicle the client must reserve it before.
    It is identified by the expiration time, the user id and the car identifier.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Notification:} It is a pop up message that is displayed on the client's smartphone. Notifications are used 
    by the application to comunicate important messages.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{System:} It is the new system, composed by a mobile application for devices running either iOS or Android. The 
    new System access the data contained in the database of the old system.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Legacy:} It is the existing system used to manage the vehicles and their state. The Legacy system is not going
    to be replaced by the new System. The two system are going to interact in order to offer to the final customer access to the service.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Safe Area:} It is one of the zones of the city in which is possible to leave the car at the end of the rent.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Re-charge Site:} It is a Safe Area in which there is the possibility to plug the car to refill the battery.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Billing Service:} It is the service that is used from the application to charge the user with the amount needed 
    to pay the ride.

    of a remote interface to the server.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Server Module:} It is the software component running on the servers of the company that provides
    the functionalities.
  \end{description}
  \subsubsection{Acronyms}
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{API:} Access point of Interface. This term is used to indicate the interfaces exposed to access a software
    service from another software service.

  \subsection{Identifying Stakeholders} The main stakeholder of the system is the company commissioning its realization. 
  Other stakeholders 
  are the city (both governance and population) in which the system has to be used,
  the other companies offering similar services and also the public transportations providers. Ecologists organizations can also be
  considered as stakeholders since this new service is going to provide a "green" alternative for moving in the city.
  \subsection{Reference Documents} This document has been written following the IEEE standard number 830-1998 "Recommmended Practice
  fir Siftware Requirements Secifications".
  \subsection{Overview} \paragraph{} The rest of this document contains an overall description of the software product
(section 2), the specific requirements for the system (section 3) and the appendix
(section 4). The appendix contains all UML diagrams useful to describe the
functionalities of the software, some scenarios and the Alloy modeling.
  \section{Overall Description}
  \subsection{Domain Properties and Assumptions}
  In this section we analyize all the properties of the application domain of the system in order to describe the environment in which it 
  operates. 
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\bullet$] All the GPS (both on the user phones and on the cars) always give the right postion.
    \item[$\bullet$] All the power level and pressure sensors mounted on the cars are giving the correct data.
    \item[$\bullet$] The previous system which manages the cars is already populated and working.
    \item[$\bullet$] The credentials provided by the user are unique (e-mail as id).
    \item[$\bullet$] If a car is marked as available, it is present on the map and it is actually available for the rent.
    \item[$\bullet$] All the cars present on the system are working properly.
    \item[$\bullet$] A car present on the system can be only in one of the following states: available, booked or in rent.
    \item[$\bullet$] The client is billed for the use of the service using an external service.
    \item[$\bullet$] Any information about the vehicles is gathered by the new System via direct access to the database of the existing system.
    \item[$\bullet$] The other system works correctly without problems.
    \item[$\bullet$] In case of any extraordinary event handling (car accidents, system not working) the operators that works 
    for the existing service will manually intervene and manage the problem.
    \item[$\bullet$] Any time a car is left unplugged with very low power level, it is not retagged as available by the existing system until the 
    power level reaches again a minimum level.
    \item[$\bullet$] We assume that is possible to check the corrispondence between Name+Surname+Birthday and Driving License Number+Expiration Date
    using an external institutional service.
    \item[$\bullet$] We assume that when a car is unlocked, the one who opens it and uses it is always the owner
    of the reservation. For this reason no further cross-check is needed.
    \item[$\bullet$] We assume that when a car is opened the user will start using it immediately.
    \item[$\bullet$] We assume that when the user concludes the session he is out of the car and the old system manages to lock the vehicle.
    \item[$\bullet$] We assume that is possible to identify without ambiguity the cars using their plate.
    \item[$\bullet$] The billing service never fails or if it does it handles internally any problem.
    \item[$\bullet$] The operators of the existing service periodically checks the cars in order to ensure that they are in proper conditions.
    \item[$\bullet$] We assume that the database with the data related to the cars is associated to a middleware that is able to notify
    the system when the status of a variable changes (e.g.: engine ignition sends a control message to the existing system which 
    changes the corresponding variable in the database. The change is advertised by the middleware to the other system)
    \item[$\bullet$] Between the moment in which the map with available cars is updated the most recent time and the moment in which 
    the user performs the booking none of the available cars has changed its status.
  \end{description}
  \subsection{Goals} \paragraph{} Here is the list of goals, intended as the actions that the system allow the user to do:
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G0]} Allows everyone to register on the system
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G1]} Allows the client to login
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G2]} Allows the client to check the cars available within a certain distance from a specified position
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G3]} Allows the client to check the cars available within a certain distance from their position
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G4]} Allows the client to book a vehicle for a rent
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G5]} Allows the client to open the booked vehicle if the booking has not expired yet and he is close to it
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G6]} Allows the client to update his/her credentials or payment details
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G7]} Conclude the rent and be notified when the rent is over and the payment is successfully completed
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G8]} Allows the client to inspect the power level of a selected car before booking it
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G9]} Allows the client to identify the localization of the safe areas where the vehicle can be left
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{[G10]} Allows the client to cancel an existing booking up to the expiration time.
  \end{description}
  \subsection{Actors Identifying}
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{User:} Everyone willing to use the application that has not been registered yet. They can‚Äôt access 
    the application functionality but the registration form.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Client:} Every registered user willing to use the application. They can access the complete functionality of the application.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Online Application Server:} This is the main brain of the application system which executes the queries of the users and clients through the Mobile Application,
    taking also into account the situation in the other actors such as Billing system and Existing System.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Mobile Application:} This is the interface from where the users can query query demands 
    and visualise the answers by the Online Application Server.
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Billing Service:} Provides APIs to charge the user with the cost of the ride.	
    \item[$\bullet$] \textbf{Existing Service:}  It is the previous system which handles the majority of situations that our application takes for granted.
  \end{description}
  \subsection{Constraints} 
  \subsubsection{Regulatory Policies}
  \paragraph{} The system requires the user smartphone location, who must agree to provide 
  it together with its e-mail, phone and personal data in order to allow a positive application performance. The form will also explain 
  its privacy law and will make users check the option 
  ‚ÄúI‚Äôve read and I agree to service terms and conditions‚Äù before proceeding to users registration.
  \subsubsection{Hardware Limitations}
  \begin{description}
    \item[$\bullet$] Mobile Application:
    \begin{enumerate}[-]
      \item Smartphone.
      \item 3G Connection.
      \item GPS enabled.
      \item 30 Mb of free space in the users device.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[$\bullet$] Online Application Service:
    \begin{enumerate}[-]
      \item Apache Server with permissions to access the existing system‚Äôs database.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{description}
  \subsubsection{Parallel Operations} The application server must support parallel operations from different 
  users or clients.
  \subsection{Interfaces to other applications} \paragraph{} The mobile application will interact with the web server,
  querying demands and retrieving the results computed by this one.
  The application server will interact with the existent system to handle general errors and to retrieves or update the data about
  the cars used for the service.
  The application server will interact with the billing system to handle all the tasks related to payments and billing.
  \section{Requirements}
  \subsection{External Interface Requirements}
  \subsubsection{User Interfaces} \paragraph{} The service is accessed by the user through a mobile application with a simple
  and immediate user interface. The user interface must be easy to understand and provide access to each 
  functionality with at most 3 taps. Example for the style of the user interface are represented by the following figures: Figure 1, Figure 2 
  and Figure 3.
  \begin{figure}

  \begin{figure}
  \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{map.jpg}
    \caption{Mock-up of the desirede interface: map}
  \end{figure}
  \subsubsection{Software Interfaces} \paragraph{} The service must communicate with the software interfaces of both the legacy
  system for the management of the cars and the billing service, which provides support for all the payment and billing operations. 
  In addition the server module must be integrated with a DBMS in order to access the data stored in the data base of the existing 
  service.
  \subsubsection{Communication Interface} \paragraph{} The client module and the server module communicate using the internet and the 
  standard TCP/IP protocol.

  The car map interface [Fig. 2] will englobe different car instances in an unified bubble if they are too
  close to be represented clearly (Google Maps API criteria), the bubble tag will indicate the number of
  cars in that zone.
  The typography and images will follow the responsive model in order to assure a good experience for
  the user in its device, resizing them depending on the particular screen-size.
  \subsubsection{Availability} The application system will be available 24h hours per day, for each day of the week.
  \subsubsection{Security} Data protection in transmission must be guaranteed during authentication phase.
  \subsubsection{Maintainability} Since is a 24/7 service, it should be continuously maintained without interrupting this policy. 
  If an update or a critical actualization is needed, it would be indicated to users in advance.
  \subsubsection{Portability} The application can be used in any iOS or Android smartphone.
  \section{Scenarios and UML Models}
  \subsection{Scenarios}
  \subsubsection{Scenario 1}
  \paragraph{} A random person needs a vehicle in order to reach his home after going out with his friends, this situation happens during night and the public 
  transport is not working and he hasn't brought his car with him. To solve this problem, our character uses the PowerEnJoy application on his smart phone, 
  that he has previously used. After logging in,  he finds a car 800 meters away from his position and even if it has just 40
  \% of the battery he books it. Once he is 2 meters away from the car the application allows him to open it so that the ride can start. Our main character 
  successfully reaches his home, but he forgets to plug the car in at the safe area, and when he sees the confirmation of the realized payment he notices that he 
  payed an additional 30\% fee.
  \subsubsection{Scenario 2}
  \paragraph{} A girl needs a car to arrive at work on time, because she didn't hear the alarm of her clock, and  remembers about the PowerEnJoy application. 
  She decides to download and install it and, as soon as she opens the application she is asked to register, After fulfilling the subscription form, she is granted 
  with a full access to the service functionalities.
  While she is leaving home, she is called by a friend, who gently offers to bring her at work with her car. For this reason, she opens the application again and
  cancels the booking.
  \subsubsection{Scenario 3}
  \paragraph{} An important lawyer is in a hurry because she needs to meet with some people in a place, she is worried because she's still on the train which leaves 
  her pretty far from her final destination. Plus, the public transports are on strike. She usually uses PowerEnJoy on those particular situations. After opening it, 
  she logs in and looks for cars in the surroundings of the train station and books a car 
  300m away from the station location. 
  As soon as she arrives, she receives a call informing that the meeting has been canceled. For this reason, she takes the train again to go back home. 
  She sits down and starts reading a book, forgetting to cancel the reservation . 
  After 1 hour she receives a notification of the expiration of his booking and of the 1\textdollar fee while she's on the train. 
  \subsubsection{Scenario 4} \paragraph{} An old guy's license expired 2 days ago. He his really concerned about the environment and about city pollution,
  so he likes to use environment friendly vehicles such as the ones provided in PowerEnJoy, an application in which he is registered since it came out to market.
  He decides to use his bike to reach the office and renew his license. After his new details are provided, he opens PowerEnJoy to update his credentials. 
  Once the server verifies them, he is notified about the successful credential update.
  \subsubsection{Scenario 5} \paragraph{}  Fabrizio is the singer of a band that plays Italian music. Usually Gigi, the only one of the group‚Äôs members 
  that had a car, goes to the house of each one of the 4 components of the group to pick them up to go to the studio where they have their rehearsals. 
  Unfortunately, Gigi‚Äôs car broke last Wednesday they don‚Äôt know how to go to the studio. 
  Fabrizio remembers about PowerEnjoy, logs into the app, checks the safe areas and sees that luckily there is a safe area with plugs really 
  close to their rehearsal‚Äôs venue. He proceeds to book the car and start the rent. He picks up his friends and, after arriving to their final destination,
  he parks and plugs it in. For this reason Fabrizio receives a double discount on it‚Äôs charge: 30\% because he plugged the car in and an additional
  10\% because he shared the ride with 3 other passengers.
